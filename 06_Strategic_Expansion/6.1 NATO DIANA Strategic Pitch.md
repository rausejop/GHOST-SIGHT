# 6.1 NATO DIANA Strategic Pitch: GHOST-SIGHT Tactical AI

## 1. Value Proposition
GHOST-SIGHT provides a **3D Volumetric Tactical Awareness** platform designed to solve the "black box" of Close Quarters Combat (CQC). By fusing High-Density LiDAR with Edge AI, we transform subjective training into objective, data-driven mission readiness.

## 2. Problem Statement
- **Training Subjectivity:** Commanders lack precise data on operator performance (Muzzle Swipe, Sectors).
- **Environmental Limitations:** Traditional optical systems fail in low-light, smoke, or dust.
- **Interoperability Gap:** Lack of standardized Digital Twins for multi-national Federated Mission Networking (FMN).

## 3. The GHOST-SIGHT Solution
- **State-of-the-Art LiDAR:** Ouster OS1 (128 channels) for centimeter-accurate 3D mapping in zero-lux.
- **Edge AI Analytics:** Real-time Pose Estimation and Ballistic Discipline alerts (<100ms).
- **NATO Interoperability:** FMN Spiral 4 compliant, generating persistent Digital Twins for AAR.

## 4. Dual-Use & Scalability
- **Defense:** Special Operations (MOE, FGNE) for high-intensity CQC.
- **Security:** Counter-terrorism units (GAR, GEO) for urban/rural hybrid environments.
- **Commercial:** Potential for industrial safety monitoring in hazardous environments (IP69K rating).

## 5. Strategic Roadmap (DIANA Accelerator)
- **Q1-Q2 (Integration):** Fusion of LiDAR + Biometrics.
- **Q3 (Validation):** Deployment in MOE (Spain) and NATO SOF exercises.
- **Q4 (Scale):** Standardization of the Tactical Digital Twin for NATO partners.
